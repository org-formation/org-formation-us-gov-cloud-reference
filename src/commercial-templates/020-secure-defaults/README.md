### Purpose of these templates
The templates in this folder deploy some of the community Resource Types that are made available through `005-types`. All of the resources in this folder implement some form of guardrails or restriction on what is possible or default within the entire organization. This limits the financial or security impact of mistakes or helps prevent them altogether.

Some notable resources in this folder:
| Resource | Description
| - | -
| Password Policy |
| Secure Defaults | Block public S3 buckets, enable default EBS encryption, opt out of AWS AI usage (privacy) 
| Access Analyzer |
